A Kafka Cluster can be used for exporting directly from STRM Privacy to
a Kafka Cluster owned by the client, or to the shared Kafka Export
Cluster, hosted by STRM Privacy. This gives all the performance,
scalability and reliability benefits offered by Kafka.

The Kafka Cluster is only a configuration object, it does not create the
actual cluster infrastructure. It only points to an existing Kafka
Cluster.

At the moment, itâ€™s not possible to create your own Kafka Cluster. All
Kafka Exporters use the STRM Privacy Shared Cluster.
